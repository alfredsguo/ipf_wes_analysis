## Background
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is increasingly recognized as a chronic, progressive, and fatal lung disease with an unknown etiology. Current studies focus on revealing the genetic factors in the risk of IPF, making the integrative analysis of genetic variations and transcriptomic alterations of substantial value.
## Aim
The aim of this study was to improve the understanding of the molecular basis of IPF through an integrative analysis of whole-exome sequencing (WES), bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data.
## Methods
WES is a powerful tool for studying the genetic basis of IPF, allowing for the identification of genetic variants that may be associated with the development of the disease. RNA-seq data provide a comprehensive view of the transcriptional changes in IPF patients, while scRNA-seq data offer a more granule view of cell-type-specific alterations.
## Results
In this study, we identified a comprehensive mutational landscape of recurrent genomic and transcriptomic variations, including SNPs, CNVs, and differentially expressed genes, in IPF populations, which may play a significant role in the development and progression of IPF.
## Conclusions
Our study provided valuable insights into the genetic and transcriptomic variations associated with IPF, revealing changes in gene expression that may contribute to disease development and progression. These findings highlight the importance of an integrative approach to understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying IPF and may pave the way for the identification of potential therapeutic targets.
